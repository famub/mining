Obesity is one of the most common health issues in today’s world, affecting individuals of all ages and different social backgrounds. It is associated with several serious diseases and complications, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, mobility problems, and an overall decrease in quality of life.

In recent years, obesity rates have increased significantly worldwide, making it one of the greatest challenges faced by healthcare systems. Therefore, there is a growing need for effective ways to predict obesity levels and prevent its negative consequences before they become more severe.

In our project, we will use two data mining tasks to help us predict the possibility of different obesity levels, which are classification and clustering.

For classification, we will train our model to classify individuals into different obesity levels such as Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obesity Type I, II, or III based on their eating habits and physical conditions, including attributes like age, weight, height, physical activity, and other related factors.

For clustering, our model will create a set of clusters for individuals who share similar characteristics. These clusters will then be used to better understand patterns in the data and to provide insights that can help in predicting obesity levels and supporting decision-making for healthcare professionals.
